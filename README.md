Backend: Node.js with Express.js to handle API requests.
Database: MongoDB for storing and managing data.

Technologies Used :

MongoDB: Database for storing application data.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js to handle API endpoints.
React.js: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
